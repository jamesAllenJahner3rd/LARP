## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (Recommended: Node.js 20+)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** for version control
- **MongoDB** (local installation recommended for development)
- **Homebrew** (for macOS MongoDB installation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd VENU
```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

4. **Install and start MongoDB:**

   **For macOS (using Homebrew):**

   ```bash
   # Install MongoDB Community Edition
   brew install mongodb-community

   # Start MongoDB service
   brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

   # Verify MongoDB is running
   brew services list | grep mongodb
   mongosh --eval "db.runCommand('ping')" --quiet
   ```

   **For other platforms:**

   - [Windows MongoDB Installation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
   - [Linux MongoDB Installation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)

5. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

   ```env
   # Database Configuration (Local MongoDB)
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/venu

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   JWT_ISSUER=venu-api
   JWT_AUDIENCE=venu-app

   # Frontend URL (for CORS)
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the provided startup scripts to run both servers simultaneously:

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

**For Windows:**

```bash
start-dev.bat
```

#### Option 2: Manual Start

1. **Start the backend server:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Start the frontend (in a new terminal):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 3: Using npm scripts

```bash
# Start both servers simultaneously
npm run dev:both

# Or start them individually
npm run dev:frontend  # Frontend only
npm run dev:backend   # Backend only
```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### MongoDB Connection Issues

**Error: `MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017`**

- **Cause:** MongoDB is not running
- **Solution:** Start MongoDB service:
  ```bash
  brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
  ```

**Error: `mongod not found`**

- **Cause:** MongoDB is not installed
- **Solution:** Install MongoDB:
  ```bash
  brew install mongodb-community
  ```

**Error: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001`**

- **Cause:** Port 3001 is already in use
- **Solution:** Kill existing processes or change port in `.env` file

#### Verification Steps

1. **Check MongoDB status:**

   ```bash
   brew services list | grep mongodb
   ```

2. **Test MongoDB connection:**

   ```bash
   mongosh venu --eval "db.runCommand('ping')" --quiet
   ```

3. **Test backend API:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

4. **Check frontend:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

#### Environment Variables Issues

**Error: `MONGODB_URI is not defined in environment variables`**

- **Cause:** `.env` file is missing or incorrectly formatted
- **Solution:** Ensure `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory with correct format

**Error: `JWT_SECRET is not defined`**

- **Cause:** JWT configuration is missing
- **Solution:** Add JWT configuration to `.env` file
